text: BURN IT! But seriously other than the Bill of Rights the whole thing needs to
  be rewriten from scratch.  Most nations rewrite constitutions every 20 years on
  average. No need to retain this document merely because of out indoctrinised reverence
  to a cabal of 18th century white supremacist tyrants. Even the freedoms enumerated
  in the Bill of Rights are routinely trampled when the interest of the ruling class
  are threatened. How many Fred Hompsons how many MLKs must they murder before we
  see this is not a land of freedom!?
