text: BURN IT! But seriously other than the Bill of Rights the whole thing needs to
  be rewriten from scratch.  Most nations rewrite constitutions every 20 years on
  average. No need to retain this document morely because of out indoctriensed reverence
  to a cobal of 18th century white supremacist ???. Even the freedoms enumerated in
  the Bill of Rights are routinely trampled when the inretest of the ruling??? class
  are threatened. How many Fred Hompsons how many MLKs must they murder before we
  see this is not a land of freedom!?
