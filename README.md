### Constitution Day

Constitution Day is an online exhibit for New College of Florida students' answers to *"What would you change about the Constitution?"* question. It uses the amazing [MonumentLab/Proposals](https://github.com/MonumentLab/proposals) Jekyll theme. This fork does not have the original images resources.
