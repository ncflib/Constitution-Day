## Constitution Day 2019
This project was made possible as a result of a several collaborative individuals, including [**Cal Murgu**](https:://calmurgu.com) and [**Atalay Kutlay**](http://atalaykutlay.com), **Winn Wasson**, and **Dani McCalla**. We thank all of the community members that contributed to this exhibit.


This site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/?id=top) by the [Digital Scholarship Studio](https://dss.ncf.edu/main), a unit within the Library that works on digital projects, culturally oriented or otherwise. Special thanks to the [Monument Lab Team](https://monumentlab.com/) for the inspiration and rocking theme.
