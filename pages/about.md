## Constitution Day

For Constitution Day 2019, the Jane Bancroft Cook Library invited the community of New College of Florida, including students, staff, and faculty to contribute to a library display by answering the following question, writing it on a postcard, and pinning it to a public board: **What would you change about the Constitution?**

Contributions were accepted physically and were pinned to a public display in the lobby of the Library. They were also accepted electronically. Physical contributions were digitized and made available on this website.


These contributions illustrate a range of perspectives, but also represent strikingly similar views. Taken as a collection of individual thoughts about the defining document of the United States, this (growing) reminds us that there is an opportunity for serious discussion about the Constitution of the United States.

This project was inspired by the good folks at [Monument Lab](https://monumentlab.com).
